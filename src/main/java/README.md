#Priority Organizer

##Description
This is a simple program which helps with organization. It takes words as input
and sets them out in an easily understandable visual format. They are contained within circles, the size of which determine the importance given to the words. In this way thoughts/priorities can be organised by size. Users can undo any changes and clear any shape they've placed.<br>
<br>
This application was built using JavaFX on the IntelliJ IDE. It makes use of class inheritance and interfaces.
<br>
<br>
Challenges which were faced along the way were to create shapes according to user input. Features which I hope to implement in the future are the ability to change the shape into a rectangle, to make the shapes in the middle of the scene and to sort shapes by size.

##Design
ShapeGenerator is an abstract class inherits from the interface location.
